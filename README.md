# Lab 10 – Arrays II

## 1. Objective
The purpose of this Lab is to familiarize students with:
1. Passing arrays to methods
2. Returning arrays from methods

## 2. Lab Learning Outcomes (LLO)
By completion of the lab, the students should be able to:
1. Pass an array to a method
2. Return an array from a method

## 3. Theory Review – Arrays and Methods
In Java, arrays can be passed to methods as parameters, allowing the method to process or modify the array elements.
Methods can also return arrays, which can then be used in other parts of the program.

### Passing an Array to a Method
The following example shows how to pass an array of integers to a method:

```java
public static void getMax(int grades[]) {
    // method body
}
